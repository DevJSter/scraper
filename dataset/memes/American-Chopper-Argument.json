IF NEVILLE AND HIS FAMILY HAD BEEN TARGETED INSTEAD, SNAPE WOULD HAVE NEVER HAD REASON TO STOP BEING A DEATH EATER. BUT HIS PATRONUS WAS A DOE! HE WAS BLINDED BY LOVE AND BY THE ABUSE HE SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF THE MARAUDERS. JAMES STOLE LILY AWAY FROM HIM. HE IS A TORTURED SOUL, AND HE CAN'T HELP THE WAY HE FEELS WHEN HE SEES A MINI JAMES POTTER WALKING AROUND. SNAPE USES HIS PAST ABUSE AS AN EXCUSE TO TAKE HIS ANGER AND RESENTMENT OUT ON CHILDREN TO MAKE HIMSELF FEEL BETTER. IF HE REALLY LOVED LILY AT ALL, AND WASN'T CREEPILY OBSESSED WITH HER, THEN HE WOULD TREAT HER SON AND HIS FRIENDS WITH A MEASURE OF FAIRNESS AND DIGNITY.

NO, WE ACTUALLY DID WIN THE WAR BECAUSE SADDAM HUSSEIN WAS \u201cTORTURING AND MURDERING THOUSANDS OF HIS PEOPLE\u201d AND THAT WAS BAD, SO WE PUT HIM TO JUSTICE THROUGH THE IRAQ GOVERNMENT, TO BE HANGED (ROSENBERG). NO! ARE YOU DUMB? WE DID LOSE THE WAR FOR SURE BECAUSE \u201cTHE DESTRUCTION OF IRAQ IMPROVED IRAN\u2019S POSITION IN THE PERSIAN GULF \u2014 WHICH IS HARDLY SOMETHING THE UNITED STATES INTENDED\u201d (WALT). DANG IT! WHY DO I ALWAYS THINK OF THINGS SO WRONG ALL THE TIME. MAYBE IT\u2019S BECAUSE THE WAR IS \u201cOFFICIALLY OVER AND MOST U.S. FORCES HAVE WITHDRAWN\u201d (WALT). GOOD!
