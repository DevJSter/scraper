After that, we can take the average of the x-intercepts to find the x-coordinate of the vertex. Then, we can plug that into the original quadratic formula to find the y-coordinate of the vertex. We can then go back to the formula again, find the value of (c), and use that as our y-intercept. After plotting those points on the coordinate plane, we can now sketch the graph. Whats 1+4 hELP"
