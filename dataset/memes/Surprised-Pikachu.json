Anyway, they had an episode called \u201cfur and loathing\u201d where a guy in a fursuit was found shot to death. Of course, the first thing the investigators did was look into the furry fandom. Where did they decide to do this? Well, the strip club of course because why not. The whole episode was about portraying furries as sexual deviants who engage in really weird kinks, and they thought that was somehow related to the dead guy.\nThe episode ended with them getting some not-so-helpful advice from a stripper with a cat mascot head that takes \u201cmade in china\u201d to a new level before finding out that the real killer was just some farmer who thought it was an actual animal late at night and shot him."
